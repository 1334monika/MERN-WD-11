<!--
  **Media Queries Explained**

  A media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3.

  It uses the `@media` rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true.

  **Syntax:**
  `@media not|only mediatype and (expressions) {
    CSS-Code;
  }`

  **`orientation` Media Feature**

  The `orientation` media feature is used to apply styles based on the orientation of the viewport (the visible area of the web page).

  - **`portrait`**: The viewport is in a portrait orientation, meaning its height is greater than or equal to its width.
  - **`landscape`**: The viewport is in a landscape orientation, meaning its width is greater than its height.

  **In this file:**

  - When the device is in **portrait mode**, the image width and height are set to `400px`.
  - When the device is in **landscape mode**, the image width and height are set to `100px`.
